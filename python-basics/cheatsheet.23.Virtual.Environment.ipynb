    "# Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a Virtual Environment is to test python code in encapsulated environments, and to also avoid filling the base Python installation with libraries we might use for only one project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install virtualenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install virtualenvwrapper-win (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install virtualenvwrapper-win\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a Virtual Environment named `HelloWorld`\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   mkvirtualenv HelloWorld\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Anything we install now will be specific to this project. And available to the projects we connect to this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set Project Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "   To bind our virtualenv with our current working directory we simply enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   setprojectdir .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deactivate\n",
    "\n",
    "   To move onto something else in the command line type `deactivate` to deactivate your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   deactivate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Notice how the parenthesis disappear.\n",

    "4. Workon\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open up the command prompt and type `workon HelloWorld` to activate the environment and move into your root project folder\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   poetry new my-project\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   This will create a my-project directory:\n",
